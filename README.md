## Commands

All build commands realize two type of API:

- IUnityPreBuildCommand
- IUnityPostBuildCommand

You can create your own command with two ways: 

![](https://github.com/UniGameTeam/UniBuild/blob/master/GitAssets/commands1.png)

1. Unity ScriptableObject command

In that case inherit your SO from - UnityBuildCommand . 
Scriptable Object Commands can be helpful when you want to share command 
between different pipelines and modify command parameters from single source

2. Serializable Regular C# class

If you choose this way, then just realise Interface API - IUnityBuildCommand , no addition actions required
